                            <p text-wrap text-justify>We understand that sometimes unforseen circumstances can occur which
                                    would lead to an absense for an upcoming event. Don't worry, we got your back.
                                    Simply cancel the event at least 3 days before to ensure that your account won't be
                                    penalized. After 3 account strikes, we will conduct an internal check and take appropriate
                                    actions where necessary.</p>
